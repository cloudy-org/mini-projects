# 🌸 What is this?
This is a monorepo of projects that are currently being experimented on or being drafted by cloudy org members. They are **NOT** finished or working products. We use this repo to avoid flooding the organisation with these types of projects alongside buggy and practice projects made by newer members.

However you are free to build whatever projects from this repo but **at your own risk.** Projects in this repo will not be maintained hence open to vulnerabilities and system crashes. Beware.
